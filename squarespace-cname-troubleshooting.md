# Troubleshooting Squarespace "Custom record not saved"

## Issue: CNAME record for @ host failing to save
Common causes and solutions:

1. **CNAME restriction with A records**
2. **DNS cache/server issues** 
3. **Squarespace validation failing**

## Screenshots of error:
- Record: @ → CNAME ynbb7icc.up.railway.app
- Message: "Unable to save this record"
- Recommendation: Contact Customer Support

## Quick Fixes:
1. Wait a few minutes and try again
2. Try using "www" host instead of "@"
3. Alternative: Ask Squarespace Support what's blocking the save
4. Platform timing: DNS servers may sync boxes before you've cleared a conflicting record.
5. Intersites too often block @ CNAME entries.—just request explicit help.

# ðŸ”— Find Your Railway LoreWise URL

## Step 1: Return to Railway Architecture
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click your project
3. Look at the "Architecture" tab (where you saw both services)

## Step 2: Get the LoreWise URL
Look at the **right service card** called "lorewise"
1. Click on the "lorewise" service card
2. Look for the **"Domains"** section OR the **"Networking"** tab
3. You should see a domain similar to:
   `https://lorewise-production.up.railway.app`

## Alternative locations in LoreWise service:
- Click the big purple "Custom Domain" or "Generate Domain" button
- OR look under the service "Overview" page for a domain link
- OR check if there's a "Networking" tab (like we saw for OnlyOffice)

## The format will be:
`https://[your-app-name]-production.up.railway.app`

---
If you don't see a direct domain:
- Click once on the right "lorewise" service
- See Networking tab â€” click "Generate Domain" or seek a publish/domain option
- that 'generated' URL is now your public app address

# DNS Propagation in Progress

## ✅ Current Status:
- LoreWise service: lorewise.io on Port 3000 ✅
- DNS records: @ and www both configured ✅
- Status: "Waiting for DNS update" ⏳

## What's Happening:
DNS changes can take 1-72 hours to propagate globally.
The 404 error is expected until DNS fully propagates.

## Next Steps:
1. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 1-24 hours)
2. Test www.lorewise.io periodically
3. Once working, test OnlyOffice integration

## Success Indicators:
- www.lorewise.io loads LoreWise app
- Document editing works with OnlyOffice
- Changes save properly

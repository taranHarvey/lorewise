# Need Redeploy After Environment Variable Change

## Status:
- ✅ OnlyOffice service: Running perfectly on port 8000
- ✅ Environment variable: Updated to include :8000
- ❌ LoreWise app: Still showing localhost:8080 error

## Issue:
LoreWise app hasn't redeployed to pick up the new environment variable

## Solution:
Force redeploy the LoreWise service to pick up the updated environment variable

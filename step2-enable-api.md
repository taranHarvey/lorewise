# Step 2: Enable Google Docs API

## In your Google Cloud project:

### Navigate to APIs & Services:
1. **Look for "APIs & Services"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click on "Library"** (under APIs & Services)

### Enable Google Docs API:
1. **Search for "Google Docs API"** in the search bar
2. **Click on "Google Docs API"** from the results
3. **Click the blue "Enable" button**
4. **Wait for it to enable** (should take a few seconds)

### Verify it's enabled:
- You should see "API enabled" with a green checkmark
- The "Enable" button should change to "Manage"

## Next: Create Service Account
Once the API is enabled, we'll create a service account to generate credentials.

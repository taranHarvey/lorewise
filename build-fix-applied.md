# Build Fix Applied

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Server-side imports**: Moved Google Docs API calls to API routes
2. **Client-side safety**: Added server-side checks
3. **Credentials handling**: Fixed JSON parsing for service account key

## Changes Made:
- Updated GoogleDocsEditor to use API routes instead of direct imports
- Fixed credentials parsing in google-docs.ts
- Added server-side safety checks

## Next:
Railway should now build successfully with Google Docs API integration.

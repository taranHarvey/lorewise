# Environment Variables Not Updating

## Issue:
Environment variables are set correctly but app still uses localhost:8080

## Possible Causes:
1. App hasn't redeployed after adding variables
2. Browser cache holding old values
3. Environment variable not being read properly

## Solutions:
1. Force redeploy in Railway
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if variables are being read in production

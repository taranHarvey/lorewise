# 404 Not Found Troubleshooting

## Current Issue:
- www.lorewise.io shows Railway 404 page
- "The train has not arrived at the station"
- Domain DNS is working (reaches Railway)
- But no app is serving the domain

## Possible Causes:
1. Deployment still failing
2. Domain not properly connected to service
3. Service not running
4. Wrong domain configuration

## Check These:
1. Railway deployment status (successful?)
2. Domain configuration in Railway
3. Service health/status
